https://askubuntu.com/questions/397674/run-scripts-automatically-in-server-after-ssh-connection

So add "ForceCommand /path/to/pyfile.py" into /etc/ssh/sshd_config. Could make that a bash script that only runs if it's the right user so that I can still log into my own account

Ok what if we made a bash file with a bunch a functions to run, then another that was just rw that stored the data, which everyone could read from but only the bash file could read from?

Also, for the time being, I can make a lock file in a directory only writeable by root but readable by everyone so that secret hitler can't start until I'm ready to.

Information that we need to include on the rw file:
	- Some way to identify the different ssh sessions
	- player names
	- num players
	- who's a fascist
	- who's hitler
	- who is the current president
	- who is the current chancellor
	- who was the last president
	- who was the last chancellor
	- cards in the deck
	- cards in the discard
	- how many fascist cards have been played so far
	- how many liberal cards have been played so far
	- what the last action was (murder, cards, loyalty, special election, etc.)
	- num of failed elections
