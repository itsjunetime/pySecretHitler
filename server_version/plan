https://askubuntu.com/questions/397674/run-scripts-automatically-in-server-after-ssh-connection

So add "ForceCommand /path/to/pyfile.py" into /etc/ssh/sshd_config. Could make that a bash script that only runs if it's the right user so that I can still log into my own account

Ok what if we made a bash file with a bunch a functions to run, then another that was just rw that stored the data, which everyone could read from but only the bash file could read from?

Also, for the time being, I can make a lock file in a directory only writeable by root but readable by everyone so that secret hitler can't start until I'm ready to.

Information that we need to include on the rw file:
	- Some way to identify the different ssh sessions: bash -c "who --lookup | cut -d \" \" -f7"
		Each time someone runs the script, it needs to run "who --lookup | cut -d \" \" -f7", log the results as an array, then find which entry of the array hasn't been registered yet, and use that as its id.
	- player names: associate with session id
	- num players: Increment each time a new ssh session is registered
	- who's a fascist
	- who's hitler
	- who is the current president
	- who is the current chancellor
	- who was the last president
	- who was the last chancellor
	- cards in the deck (in order, use shuffle function at the very beginning and then pop them in order)
	- cards in the discard
	- how many fascist cards have been played so far
	- how many liberal cards have been played so far
	- what the last action was (murder, cards, loyalty, special election, etc.)
	- num of failed elections
	- if the government has veto power
	- Probably a string with the rules lol

Ok looks like this above section may not be the way to go after all, since the server appears to only support RSA keys.. can't help everyone load those in; also don't want to

Looks like a django web app may be the way to go; works with sqlite databases by default. Could just edit and read from that.
Interface would just be the hard part to set up correctly...

Could make a data() class or something like that; could hold all the default settings and just create everything there that I need and necessary functions to edit what needs to be edited.

Also should probably make a player() class, with functions that are basically wrappers for settings functions; just cause OOP ya know
 
Nah we're doing port forwarding my guy
